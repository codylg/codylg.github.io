          He says I have hips like the wrong end of an axe, and every time we fuck, all he can think about is that scene from American Psycho, about how it is possible to revel in the guttural instinct that is destroying someone over, over.
          He turns me around often, thinks it’s safer that way.
          Hips like axe heads, eyes like daggers.
          He knows enough to know that you only get hurt when the pointy end of the knife is facing you.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Be careful with me,” I say.
          Grab me the wrong way and he might not come out with any fingers.
          He think’s that’s better than gutting himself.
          He says that I’m the kind of girl that’s going to bleed him dry.

        <p>Mostly when we wake he leaves. Sometimes he has already left and I wake alone to damp sheets and too much light in my bedroom. Summer has come at 80% humidity and the promised storm that never broke. Every day is thighs stuck to linoleum bus seats, extra ice in my gin and the number of spaces between the girl and the air conditioning.</p>
        <p>“I don’t know how you can drink that stuff,” he tells me on the mornings that he stays. We sit on the verandah and watch my back yard fall over itself to be unkempt. The sky is cerulean blue. Sweat pearls on my upper lip with every sip of tea, but I feel better for the remedy. When I live like this, my lips are never dry.</p>
        <p>The kind of person that takes cue from his telephone, Luke stands on its sound, tucks the button up into his black slacks and rolls sleeves to the elbow. “Taxi’s here,” he says and asks me to hold the dog. Nip lies quiet beneath my chair. She is only interested in men who do not love me when they are hurting me. I remain seated. He exhales sharply and says something and leaves. I am happy about that. I have never understood staying. The staying is the opportunity for pain.</p>
        <p>Whereas Luke will travel back towards the city today, I will spend my Saturday on the outer edge of my suburb and it will not rain. I say this with certainty, as it has not rained in some time. Although I am exposed only to Brisbane’s quiet curling of grass and the way the sun slaps footpath and how the bitumen will cook you breakfast where you stay the night, I know that travel west and the Downs are close to fire. The farmers have taken to watering their tenure with blood.</p>
        <p>If I were the kind of person to write home, my mother would tell me that they do not cry at the funerals because they are practical people who will not waste water unnecessarily and I would tell her that I have seen them sweat. </p>

        <p>There is noise inside the house. “Gone?” Jacob calls from a place I cannot see. I collect my cup and walk into the kitchen; I say gone and he says good. Jacob does not like Luke. Nip is my shadow, lies now at the door while I boil the kettle for another cup of tea. She temps the line between inside and out, enjoies the cool of the wooden floorboards and the breeze that slips up from under the house. Wineglasses lie in the sink, they need washing so I wash them. Red has dried to purple, forms stubborn circles over the chipboard bench. I wipe and wipe but as it turns out, not everything comes out in the wash. There is stain.</p>
        <p>It is eight a.m. and I am already a mix of dark and sweat beneath the cotton shirt. The weatherman has forecast no storm for today, but in and of me, at the humid crevices of my body and on the outsides of my ankles, I brew and eventually will will break.</p>
        <p>I lean against the counter to eat my breakfast, cereal and milk in bowl. My head throbs only distantly. Although I know I should be ill, I am disrupted only by the expectation rather than the actuality of the hangover.  </p>
        <p>Outside, the grass needs cutting and there are weeds growing between my herbs. I am a part-time gardener; this Jacob has told me many times.</p>
        <p>“I’ll cut the grass,” he says, when he eventually enters the kitchen. I think he is pulling shirt over the expanse of chest but I do not check. The sight is no longer exciting. I nod my thanks. He flicks the already boiled kettle, wants heat and caffeine and life.</p>
        <p>“Did you get in late last night?”</p>
        <p>“Not as late as you.”</p>
        <p>“Sorry,” I say. “I thought you were still at Smiths’.”</p>
        <p>“Not last night. His girl came home early, so I came home early. It’s ok though, I got to test out the Beats.”</p>
        <p>“Oh.”</p>
        <p>“They work well.”</p>
        <p>“Good.” Jacob grins at me in a way I believe is unfair.</p>
        <p>“Much on the cards today?”</p>
        <p>“Just chores. Probably steal some things from downstairs later and walk Nip this arvo. You?”</p>
        <p>“Heading to the markets at ten. Want a lift?”</p>
        <p>“Yeah,” I say. “I’ll grab a lift. Thanks.”</p>
        <p>As Jacob brings the lawnmower to life, weaving it down the hill and then dragging in back up behind him, I mop the verandah having swept Nip’s red fur away.  Although water makes the wood ashy, it dries as dead and as brown as it was before. Jacob’s been talking about staining it for a year now, but he says we need to repaint the railings first. I tell him that we don’t own the property and he shrugs. He tells me you should always try to improve where you are right now for anyone that comes later.</p>
        <p>Heat does not trap on the verandah as it does elsewhere in the house so I linger after my work is done, leaning at the rail where blue has flaked away to weathered and wood.</p>
        <p>The Queenslander was once a six bedroom home on a double block, now split down the middle, hung and quartered by vacant drifters. In my bedroom, I can hear the sounds of my alcoholic neighbor when he occasionally engages in sex. He grunts for a while, and then his girl or his hand gets tired. I don’t need to wonder what it is like to be so tired of yourself that you give up half-way through masturbating. This is perhaps why I help him with his keys on the nights he cannot fit them in the lock instead of pretending that I am not home.</p>
        <p>He gardens often and his side of the fence is much more beautiful than ours. He is full-time in everything that he does. His youthful aspirations included a government pension at age sixty-five and he got that. Of course, his wife left, and his children call rarely. He is not an impressive man. He prevails.</p>
        <p>Jacob and I have the first backyard to Jens’ second, all leopard tree and half-mown grass and some bantams that wandered in one day and forgot to leave. Jacob likes the chickens more than I do, has more time for stupid things. He built them a home when his NewStart came through, with timber and wire and hay for the hutch, and run that kept them from Nip. We drove to Bunnings, and he chose the materials, then told me he would have no money for textbooks. I glared softly while the girl at the checkout asked for cash or card. Yes, I would pay for half. I like the way our compost no longer wastes.</p>
        <p>The mower goes quiet and I hear it clatter back into place beneath the house. “Did you feed the chooks this morning, Aud?” Jacob calls from below.</p>
        <p>“No yet.”</p>
        <p>“Pass us the bucket and I’ll head down now.” His hair is wet with sweat, swept right and off his face. His cheeks are red. Dark patches form on his shirt, beneath armpits and over the expanse of his back. He loves the sunburned country, but not in a colonial way. In a time immemorial way. He will always belong.</p>
        <p>The morning is so loud and warm and becoming that words seem heavy and fires seem imminent. The sun shines through the leaves, turning membrane yellow; the bush hums. I take some water from out of the fridge and grab the re-appropriated ice-cream container from the kitchen bench. It smells of day-old paw-paw, decaying citrus and other organic demise. Jacob leans against the railing of the stairs, squinting through the heat. Nip lies beneath the table to my left.</p>
        <p>“Here,” I cross the verandah to hand the rot to him, and the water too.</p>
        <p>“Cheers,” he says. He pauses, still breathing heavy from the work. He drinks greedily and lines gush from the sides of his mouth to form fresh water rivers despite the body of salt. “Your skirt’s see-through, by the way,” he says. I glare, grab the bottle from him.</p>
        <p>“So’s your charm.”</p>
        <p>He laughs me back into the house’s shadows, where I am backlit by no ethereal summer haze.</p>
