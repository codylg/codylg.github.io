    | iOS'86 was a long-term project that developed into one of the most expansive 
    strong iPhone themes
    |  available. Based on the concept design by 
    a(href="http://work.repponen.com/" target="_blank") Anton Repponen
    | , iOS'86 is the official and fully functional Winterboard theme for iPhone and iPod Touch.
  p
    | Including thousands of hand-pixeled monochrome graphics along with a port of the original Chicago font; iOS'86 takes your device back to another era.
    | Available on iOS 4, 5, and 6.
