  p
    | At Scrunch I worked with a small team to build their data-driven 
    a(href="//app.scrunch.com", target="_blank") influencer marketing platform
    |  from the ground up.
    | As 
    strong lead UI/UX
    |, I oversaw end-to-end feature development from concept to deployment, as well as helping to develop a roadmap of the product direction.
  p
    | My responsibilities included: user interface &amp; user experience design,
    | responsive web design, front-end development, prototyping, animation &amp; motion design,
    | user testing & analytics, QA/testing, agile development,
    | CSS/Sass, HTML, Git, program management, branding & graphic design.
  p
    | I also designed and developed the 
    a(href="//scrunch.com", target="_blank") scrunch.com landing page
    |  and 
    a(href="//scrunch.com/blog", target="_blank") blog
    | .
