      h1 Q: What's this all about?
      p
        | A: This is an experiment combining some new CSS properties and JS events with photography; 
        strong exploring tangible methods of interacting with digital photographs
        | .
        | Layers of the exposure are blended together in the browser using the 
        code mix-blend-mode
        |  property. These layers are then trimmed to the silhouette with the 
        code mask-image
        |  property.
      h1 Devices
      p
        | If you're visiting on a device with a cursor, the exposure will react to mouseovers.
        | This is probably the ideal device type to view this experiment with.
        | The cursor coordinates are used to apply transforms (translations and rotations) across the layers of the exposure.
      p
        | If you're visiting on a device with an accelerometer — e.g. a smartphone — you'll see the exposure react to the device tilting and panning.
        | The 
        code deviceorientation
        |  event sends down the 
        code beta
        |  and 
        code gamma
        |  orientation, which is then adjusted and applied as transforms (translations) across the layers of the exposure.

        | Browsers that don't support CSS masking or blend modes will load a static backup image instead.
